- add Import as alias for Read

0.1.17
- Windows newline support in tsv parser, and allow overriding delimiter choice

- To command can now handle multiple slices simultaneously
- Rename(fieldname=('f1','f2')) type of command now supported to rename multiple slices with same name

0.1.19
- Added a primitive format detection.
- Fixed gz unpacking
- Added FASTA read support
- Allow user to add custom formats
- Add Detect function, to determine unknown types, and cast e.g. string types to integers where possible
