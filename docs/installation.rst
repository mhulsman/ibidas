Installation
============

If one has the ``setuptools`` package installed, one can simply perform::

    easy_install ibidas

to install ibidas and its necessary dependencies. 


Starting ibidas
---------------
To start ibidas, one can simply execute::

    ibidas

on the command line prompt. This will load the ``IPython`` interpreter, with
Ibidas already loaded. 

If one instead wants to load ibidas within an script or interpreter process, 
one can simply use::

    from ibidas import *

For the rest of this tutorial, we assume the standard Ibidas interpreter is used.
