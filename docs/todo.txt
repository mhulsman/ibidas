dimids:
- if a dim is shared for a whole tuple, use name of tuple field if available
  for dimension field (post-processor?)
- naming for tuples without specifying whole type (post-processor)

- adapt type parser to reps  

- dimension specification has to be only given once:
  ([d1:4]>bytes[3], [d1]>bytes[3])


mapseq, aggregation: ability to specify dimension
ops: inheritance
hops: unique, set operations
